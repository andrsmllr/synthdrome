Synthdrome provides resource estimation for basic RTL components on different FPGA architectures.  
A set of basic HDL components which can be automatically synthesized for different FPGA architectures is provided.  
The ultimate goal is to allow early comparison of expected device utilization and packing density for different FPGAs.  
FPGA architectures of a wide range of vendors should be covered: Xilinx, Intel/Altera, Lattice, Microsemi as well as new ones like Efinix.

How many Xilinx Spartan 6 CLBs make an Intel/Altera Cyclone V LAB? How many Altera Cyclone V LABs make a Lattice MachXO3 PFU? How many Lattice MachXO3 PFUs make a Microsemi IGLOO2 LE?  
Time to find out.
