# synthdrome
Synthdrome provides resource estimation for basic RTL components of different FPGA architectures.  
A set of basic components is provided and can be automatically synthesized for different FPGA architectures.  
The ultimate goal is to allow early comparison of expected device utilization and packing density for different FPGAs.  
FPGA architectures of a wide range of vendors should be covered: Xilinx, Intel/Altera, Lattice, Microsemi as well as new ones like Efinix.
